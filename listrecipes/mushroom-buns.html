    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>white sugar</li>
        <li>vegetable oil</li>
        <li>milk (may be substituted with water)</li>
        <li>active dry yeast</li>
        <li>cacao powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar and active dry yeast with the milk</li>
        <li>Add all-purpose flour and milk mixture in a large mixing bowl, and combine well with a spatula. Keep kneading it until the dough forms.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to the table, and knead it for another 10 to 15 minutes until it becomes smooth.</li>
        <li>Then, set the dough in a clean bowl and cover it with plastic film. Let the dough rise for an hour at room temperature until it turns to double the size.</li>
        <li>After first proofing, gently knead the dough to release the air from it. Roll the dough into a long strip shape. Then cut it into 7 equal pieces. Roll the 6 of them into the balls, and set them aside. And leave the last one to make the bottom part of the mushroom, which divides it into 6 pieces and rolls them into the water drop shapes. Set them aside for the second time proofing (30 minutes).</li>
        <li>In a clean small bowl, mix 1 Tbsp of the Cacao powder and 5g sugar with 2 Tbsp hot water. Brush the chocolate paste on each of the doughs. Let them dry during the second time proofing.</li>
        <li>Second time proofing- Place each of the brushed doughs on a piece of parchment paper, and let them rise to double the size at room temperature for 30 minutes to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring the water to boil in a steamer, and steam the buns for 10 minutes on high heat. Turn off the heat, leave the buns inside for extra 3 minutes before you open the lid. (Make sure to steam the top and bottom parts of the mushrooms separately).</li>
        <li>Assembling the mushroom. Poke a small hole under the top part, and insert the bottom part into it to make a mushroom appearance.</li>
