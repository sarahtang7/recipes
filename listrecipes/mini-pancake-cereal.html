    <p>mini pancake cereal is a perfect sweet way to start your day!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar or sweetener</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder and salt in a large-sized bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg.</li>
        <li>Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until smooth and lump-free. Add 1-2 extra tablespoons of milk if needed to just slightly thin out the batter. You don't want to it too runny.</li>
        <li>Let your pancake batter sit for about 5 minutes while heating a nonstick pan or griddle over medium-high heat. Lightly grease with a little butter or cooking oil (see notes).</li>
        <li>Pour pancake batter into a squeezable condiment/sauce bottle. (Alternatively, use a ziplock bag: cut a tiny hole on an angle in the bottom corner of the bag to pipe out the batter.)</li>
        <li>Squeeze small dots of batter onto HOT greased pan. Cook until the tops form bubbles and look set/dry. Flip with a spatula and cook until golden on the undersides, about a further 1-2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter, lightly greasing your pan between each batch.</li>
        <li>Serve with maple syrup, honey, fruit, ice cream, frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!</li>
    </ol>
