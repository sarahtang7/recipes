    <p>ready for a fun and delicious delicacy! well you're at the right place! to learn how to make cloud bread, keep reading! </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Egg whites</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Cornstarch</li>
        <li>Food coloring (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whip the egg whites. Add your egg whites to a very clean, grease free bowl. Start to whip your egg whites on medium-low, until frothy and pale.</li>
        <li>Stir in sugar. Add the sugar, a little bit at a time on high, until the sugar dissolves and the egg whites start to foam up.</li>
        <li>Add the cornstarch. I like to sift the cornstarch in so that there are no lumps. Continue to whip on high until the egg whites become a glossy thick meringue that holds a peak. The egg whites are done when you lift the beater from the bowl and they hold a peak and look smooth and creamy like shaving cream If you tilt the bowl, the whites should not slide. Be careful not to over whip!</li>
        <li>Shape the cloud. Use a rubber spatula to scoop out the meringue and shape into a cloud on a parchment paper lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake. Bake in a low oven until golden and cooked through.</li>
    </ol>
